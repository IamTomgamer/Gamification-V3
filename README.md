Gamification App with:

Warning:

opening the app on MacOS is very likely to prompt this popup:\

Don't worry, the app does not connect to the internet at all, it is 100% safe.\
You can open it by going into system settings > Privacy & Security > scroll down to: "GamificationV3 was blocked to protect your mac" > click Open Anyway.
you will only need to do this once. after this, it will work fully
